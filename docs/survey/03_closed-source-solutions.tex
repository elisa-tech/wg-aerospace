The world of safety-critical Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOSes) and hypervisors is a small one, dominated by a handful of commercial, closed-source players: DDC-I, Green Hills Software, Lynx Software Technologies, Sysgo, and Wind River. These offer relatively expensive solutions that provide assurance evidence suitable to permit their use at the highest levels of criticality. This evidence is typically in the form of a certification package that contains software life cycle data per DO-178C. 

While many of these proprietary offerings have been part of aircraft certified up to DO-178C Software Level A (the most critical), open source solutions using Linux have only been flight certified to date up to Level D.
