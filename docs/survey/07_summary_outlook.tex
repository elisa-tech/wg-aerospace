\section{Summary and Outlook}
\label{sec:summary_outlook}

Many papers considering Linux for aerospace applications focus on real-time performance requirements. Many of them identify various means of adjustment or customization that enable a Linux implementation to meet these requirements. In summary, it appears that a properly configuration and tuned Linux operating system is suitable for most real-time aerospace use cases.

Most of the papers considering Linux for aerospace applications completely ignore certification issues. Those that do mention the quality assurance effort via validation and verification do not recognize the colossal effort this represents. It is our conclusion that despite all the focus on real-time performance, this is not the main barrier to adoption of Linux in aerospace. Rather, the primary obstacle is the high cost of safety assurance. This is borne out by the more prevalent use of Linux in space and military use-cases compared to the the dearth of published examples for commercial flight, particularly at higher DO-178C software levels corresponding to higher criticality requirements.
