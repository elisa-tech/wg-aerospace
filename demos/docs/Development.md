# Development

## Overview

The following instructions assume that you've completed the [Environment Setup](./EnvSetup.md).

### Get a development shell

1) Similar to [Environment Start Here](./EnvSetup.md#start-here) get a Linux shell in your respective environment.
2) Navigate to your clone of this project and [cd demos/copilot/src/monitors/](../copilot/src/monitors/).
3) Execute the following to get a `development environment shell` within our container.

   ```bash
   make dev
   ```
4) At this point you're in the docker container with all the tools to do testing and rebuild of the demos.
5) The `copilot` folder has been mounted as `/demo/` within the container.  This is the only persistant folder between invocations of the container.
6) To verify you're still in the container you can check existance, e.g., `ls /demo`.
7) To exit the container, type `exit` in the shell and it will close the shell and shutdown.

#### Setup the development shell cross compiling (emulated target apps)

1) Before entering the `make dev` environment, navigate to your clone of this project and [cd demos/copilot/src/monitors/](../copilot/src/monitors/).
2) Execute `make prep_cross` to retrieve the latest pre-built Linux images and cross toolchain.  This stores the archives and extracted form of these in the `monitors` folder.  It also invokes the toolchains relocation logic that needs to setup cross tool's LDPATH(s).
3) Enter the `make dev` containerized environment.
4) If you want the cross tools to become the default (i.e., "CC, LD, ARCH" env vars), navigate to the following folder and run a environment script to export all the variables in the local shell for use.

   ```
   cd /demo/monitors/aarch64-buildroot-linux-musl_sdk-buildroot/
   . environment-setup
   ```
5) If you're on Windows and have VSCode open + attached to a WSL distro (WSL and Docker Extensions), you can attach to the now running container to do GUI development.  (Similar on Linux minus the WSL distro portion. VSCode should be able to attach using the Docker extension.)
6) To exit the container, type `exit` in the shell and it will close the shell and shutdown.  If you were attached with VSCode, that will also terminate.

#### Using VSCode with the active development container

1) Environment pre-req
   1) Windows: Open VSCode and have the `WSL + Docker Extensions`
      1) Attached to a WSL distro you're using for this work using `><` icon in bottom left.
   2) Linux: Open VSCode and have the `Docker Extension`.
2) Attach to the now running container to do GUI development using `><` icon in bottom left and picking it from the list.
3) At this point you can open folders, workspaces and start additional shells within the GUI.
4) If you exit the container in your non-VSCode shell, it will terminate the VSCode attachment.  Vs. If you stop VSCode, the container will continue to run until the non-VSCode original shell is exited.

### Using the Linux emulation

#### Makefile example

The [Makefile](../copilot/src/monitors/Makefile) has a streamlined example of doing a build and running one of the use case's test suites within the emulation.  This is the sequence to go through those steps.

```
make clean                          # Removes built apps, objects and generated files
make prep_cross_clean               # Removes cross environment images and toolchain
make prep_cross                     # Gets the latest pre-built Linux images and cross toolchain
make main_syslog_time_cross         # Builds application under test
make main_syslog_time_cross_run     # Run the QEMU emulation with images containing "main_syslog_time_cross" artifacts
```

At this point you're within the QEMU emulation.  Run the following to execute the tests.

```
# Login as "root" without a password
cd monitors/ && ../tests/runtests.sh
```

To verify you're in the QEMU emulation, you can check the `/etc/os-release` which will state it's a "Buildroot" image.

To exit QEMU - `ctrl-a x`.  This puts you back in your Linux environment outside of the `container` and `emulation`.

#### Manually pull the pieces together and running the emulation

This section assumes you've at least followed the ["Setup the development shell cross compiling"](#setup-the-development-shell-cross-compiling-emulated-target-apps) steps and are currently in a shell started by `make dev`.

The following uses makefile targets from [Makefile](../copilot/src/monitors/Makefile) as examples.  The examples need to not have the "Run" and "Command" prefix set.  (TBD improve the Makefile for direct use inside the `make dev` environment.)

1) `main_syslog_time_cross` target shows the steps you could repeat inside the `make dev` environment to build the application locally.  It includes a step to package the application into the cpio emulation filesystem.  The [modifying a rootfs](ModifyRootfsCpio.md) document has more details on adding other content to the CPIO.
2) `main_syslog_time_cross_run` to see how to run the qemu emulation.

### Make targets and how to iterate/clean

#### Get new emulated environment tools and archive

This section covers how to update to a new emulated environment and SDK/toolchain.  It forces all the artifacts to be retrieved and reconfigured.

```bash
make prep_cross_clean
rm -f archive.tar # tmp, need this MR to merge to fix cleanup
make prep_cross
# At this point `make dev` could be used for development with the new toolchain
```
