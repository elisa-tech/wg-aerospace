## Build

OS buildsystem

```
Clone
Cross build OS.....
```

Clone use case codebase

```
git clone https://github.com/elisa-tech/wg-aerospace.git
```

Cross Build Test Apps and Copilot compile monitor

```
cd wg-aerospace/demos/copilot
... do work....
```

## Launch

Logical steps

- Setup emulation parts , run example
  - Do we want to draw a mermaid diagram and have copilot auto gen the monitor?
- Example modifying kernel config (run for consistent results)
- Example modifying app behavior (run for consistent results)
- Tailor copilot spec (run for consistent results)
- Modify system to prove spec/monitor tailoring captures intended behavior

Launch sequence (raw frames)

1. TBD, need to work out emulation and more details of networking....

```
call sequence....
```

## Observations

How to extend / using it for your own cases.

Do we want to draw a mermaid diagram and have copilot auto gen the monitor?
