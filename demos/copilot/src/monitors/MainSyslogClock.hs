-- | External input that indicates whether the lights are on.

-- * System Requirements

-- | SR1: The Cabin Lights system shall turn lights on in less than 500 ms of
--        the light switch turning on.
--
-- EC: the light switch turns on and, for 500 ms, the lights remain off.
--
-- EC (refined): If the lights are either still off or just turned on, the
-- switch is on, and it was turned on more than 500 ms ago.
monitor1 :: Stream Bool
monitor1 = (lightsOff || lightsTurnedOn)
        && switchOn

-- | SR2: The Cabin Lights system shall turn lights off in less than 500 ms of
--        the light switch turning off.
--
-- EC: the light switch turns off and, for 500 ms, the lights remain on.
--
-- EC (refined): If the lights are either still on or just turned off, the
-- switch is off, and it was turned off more than 500 ms ago.
monitor2 :: Stream Bool
monitor2 = (lightsOn || lightsTurnedOff)
        && switchOff

-- * Main program

-- | Main Copilot entry.
main :: IO ()
main =
  -- Copilot supports multiple actions, including running an interpreter to
  -- debug specs, and running formal analysis to prove properties about a
  -- system. In this case, we only care about compiling to C.
