+# Core Flight Software CMake / GNU make wrapper
+#
+# ABOUT THIS MAKEFILE:
+# It is a GNU-make wrapper that calls the CMake tools appropriately
+# so that setting up a new build is fast and easy with no need to
+# learn the CMake commands.  It also makes it easier to integrate
+# the build with IDE tools such as Eclipse by providing a default
+# makefile that has the common targets such as all/clean/etc.
+#
+# Use of this file is optional.
+#
+# This file is intended to be placed at the TOP-MOST level of the mission
+# source tree, i.e. a level above "cfe".  Note this is outside the cfe
+# repository which is why it cannot be delivered directly in place.
+# To use it, simply copy it to the top directory.  As this just contains
+# wrappers for the CMake targets, it is unlikely to change.  Projects
+# are also free to customize this file and add their own targets after
+# copying it to the top of the source tree.
+#
+# For _ALL_ targets defined in this file the build tree location may
+# be specified via the "O" variable (i.e. make O=<my-build-dir> all).
+# If not specified then the "build" subdirectory will be assumed.
+#
+# This wrapper defines the following major targets:
+#  prep -- Runs CMake to create a new or re-configure an existing build tree
+#    Note that multiple build trees can exist from a single source
+#    Other control options (such as "SIMULATION") may be passed to CMake via
+#    make variables depending on the mission build scripts.  These will be
+#    cached in the build tree so they do not need to be set again thereafter.
+#
+#  all -- Build all targets in the CMake build tree
+#
+#  install -- Copy all files to the installation tree and run packaging scripts
+#     The "DESTDIR" environment variable controls where the files are copied
+#
+#  clean -- Clean all targets in the CMake build tree, but not the build tree itself.
+#
+#  distclean -- Entirely remove the build directory specified by "O"
+#      Note that after this the "prep" step must be run again in order to build.
+#      Use caution with this as it does an rm -rf - don't set O to your home dir!
+#
+#  doc -- Build all doxygen source documentation.  The HTML documentation will be
+#      generated under the build tree specified by "O".
+#
+#  usersguide -- Build all API/Cmd/Tlm doxygen documentation.  The HTML documentation
+#      will be generated under the build tree specified by "O".
+#
+#  osalguide -- Build OSAL API doxygen documentation.  The HTML documentation will
+#      be generated under the build tree specified by "O".
+#
+#  test -- Run all unit tests defined in the build.  Unit tests will typically only
+#      be executable when building with the "SIMULATION=native" option.  Otherwise
+#      it is up to the user to copy the executables to the target and run them.
+#
+#  lcov -- Runs the "lcov" tool on the build tree to collect all code coverage
+#      analysis data and build the reports.  Code coverage data may be output by
+#      the "make test" target above.
+#
+
+# Establish default values for critical variables.  Any of these may be overridden
+# on the command line or via the make environment configuration in an IDE
+O ?= build
+ARCH ?= native/default_cpu1
+BUILDTYPE ?= debug
+INSTALLPREFIX ?= /exe

+        Define how the topic ID table is arranged into commands and telemetry
+        Note that this works in tandem with the C implementation of the mapping functions in cfe_missionlib
+        The default/reference implementation of the TC/TM component mappings uses a flat topic ID table
+        where one portion of this table represents commands and the other porition represents telemetry, and
+        the entire table should be small enough that direct lookup tables can be generated without hogging
+        too much memory.
+
+        In this implementation the BASE is inclusive and the MAX is exclusive, just like C arrays.
+        The real values will start at 1 and zero should be reserved as an invalid index.
+
+        Also note that it is entirely possible to write a plugin script for the toolchain that could generate
+        all of these topic ID indices based on the presence of EDS files.  However, that would affect backward
+        compatibility as topic IDs (and therefore APIDs) could get reassigned more frequently as configuration
+        changes are made.  Such changes would not be an issue if EDS were used across the board, but until that

+/** \cfeescfg Poll timer for startup sync delay

+**      During startup, some tasks may need to synchronize their own initialization
+**      with the initialization of other applications in the system.
+**
+**      CFE ES implements an API to accomplish this, that performs a task delay (sleep)
+**      while polling the overall system state until other tasks are ready.
+**
+**      This value controls the amount of time that the CFE_ES_ApplicationSyncDelay
+**      will sleep between each check of the system state.  This should be large enough
+**      to allow other tasks to run, but not so large as to noticeably delay the startup
+**      completion.
+**
+**      Units are in milliseconds
+**
+**  \par Limits:

+#
+# Master config file for cFS target boards
+#
+# This file indicates the architecture and configuration of the
+# target boards that will run core flight software.
+#
+# The following variables are defined per board, where <cpuname>
+# is a specific name within MISSION_CPUNAMES list:
+#
+#  MISSION_CPUNAMES : list of user-friendly cpu names.  Should be simple
+#       words with no punctuation.  This MUST be specified.
+#  <cpuname>_PROCESSORID : numerical identifier for the processor
+#  <cpuname>_APPLIST : list of applications to build and install on the CPU.
+#       These are built as dynamically-loaded applications and installed
+#       as files in the non-volatile storage of the target, and loaded
+#       at runtime via the startup script or commands.
+#  <cpuname>_STATIC_APPLIST : list of applications to build and statically
+#       link with the CFE executable.  This is similar to the "APPLIST"
+#       except the application is built with STATIC linkage, and it is
+#       included directly when linking the CFE core executable itself.
+#       No separate application file is generated for these apps.
+#  <cpuname>_STATIC_SYMLIST : list of symbols to include in the OSAL static
+#       symbol lookup table.  Each entry is a comma-separated pair containing
+#       the symbol name and virtual module/app name, such as
+#           My_C_Function_Name,MY_APP
+#       The first item must be a publicly-exposed C symbol name available to
+#       the linker at static link time, generally the entry point/main function
+#       of the module or library (see STATIC_APPLIST).  The second item is the
+#       module name that should match the name used in the CFE startup script
+#       (4th parameter).
+#       IMPORTANT:  For this to work, the OS_STATIC_LOADER configuration option
+#       must be specified in the osconfig.h for that CPU.
+#  <cpuname>_PSP_MODULELIST : additional PSP "modules" to link into the
+#       CFE executable for this target.  These can be device drivers or
+#       other bits of modular PSP functionality that provide I/O or other
+#       low level functions.
+#  <cpuname>_FILELIST : list of extra files to copy onto the target.  No
+#       modifications of the file will be made.  In order to differentiate
+#       between different versions of files with the same name, priority
+#       will be given to a file named <cpuname>_<filename> to be installed
+#       as simply <filename> on that cpu (prefix will be removed).  These
+#       files are intended to be copied to the non-volatile storage on the
+#       target for use during runtime.
+#  <cpuname>_EMBED_FILELIST : list of extra files which are to be converted
+#       into data arrays and linked with/embedded into the CFE executable,
+#       so the content of the files can be available at runtime on systems
+#       that do not have run time non-volatile storage.  The format of each
+#       list entry is a comma-separated pair of variable and file name:
+#            VARIABLE_NAME,FILE_NAME
+#       The binary contents of the file will subsequently be available as:
+#            extern const char VARIABLE_NAME_DATA[] and
+#            extern const unsigned long VARIABLE_NAME_SIZE
+#       The same prefix-based filename mapping as used on FILELIST is also
+#       employed here, allowing CPU-specific data files to be used.
+#  <cpuname>_SYSTEM : the toolchain to use for building all code.  This
+#       will map to a CMake toolchain file called "toolchain-<ZZZ>"
+#       If not specified then it will default to "cpu<x>" so that
+#       each CPU will have a dedicated toolchain file and no objects
+#       will be shared across CPUs.
+#       Otherwise any code built using the same toolchain may be
+#       copied to multiple CPUs for more efficient builds.
+#  <cpuname>_PLATFORM : configuration for the CFE core to use for this
+#       cpu.  This determines the cfe_platform_cfg.h to use during the
+#       build.  Multiple files/components may be concatenated together
+#       allowing the config to be generated in a modular fashion.  If
+#       not specified then it will be assumed as "default <cpuname>".
+#
+
+# The MISSION_NAME will be compiled into the target build data structure
+# as well as being passed to "git describe" to filter the tags when building
+# the version string.
+SET(MISSION_NAME "SampleMission")
+
+# SPACECRAFT_ID gets compiled into the build data structure and the PSP may use it.
+# should be an integer.
+SET(SPACECRAFT_ID 0x42)

+# The "MISSION_CORE_MODULES" will be built and statically linked as part
+# of the CFE core executable on every target.  These can be used to amend
+# or override parts of the CFE core on a mission-specific basis.
+#list(APPEND MISSION_CORE_MODULES mymodule)
+
+# The "MISSION_GLOBAL_APPLIST" is a set of apps/libs that will be built
+# for every defined target.  These are built as dynamic modules
+# and must be loaded explicitly via startup script or command.
+# This list is effectively appended to every TGTx_APPLIST in targets.cmake.
+# Example:
+list(APPEND MISSION_GLOBAL_APPLIST sample_app sample_lib)
+
+# The "MISSION_GLOBAL_STATIC_APPLIST" is similar to MISSION_GLOBAL_APPLIST
+# but the apps are statically linked.
+# This list is effectively appended to every TGTx_STATIC_APPLIST in targets.cmake.
+# Example:
+#   list(APPEND MISSION_GLOBAL_STATIC_APPLIST my_static_app)
