## ELISA Aerospace Working Group, Paper-focused Meeting

The Aerospace Working Group shall develop use cases to inform and influence Linux architecture and related tools, work to derive technical requirements for avionics operating systems, and seek to enhance and expand avionics software lifecycle processes, practices, and tools to enable use of Linux in avionics systems that are certified to high design assurance levels. (<https://lists.elisa.tech/g/aerospace>)

# Minutes

- DASC abstract submitted. Results expected on early/mid March. If accepted, full paper by April.
- Ivan Rodriguez is interested to contribute in the space paper. Would like to contribute but cannot coordinate the writing alone due to lack of deep expertise. If another person volunteers to start, he can participate actively
- WG reviewed the status of the tasks
- Discussion on the relevance of some space works mentioned in Section 6. Still within the paper scope because they are related to flight/avionics ie. rockets and drones in another planet. Added a sentence in the relevant section to clarify that.
- used the rest of the call time to work on the paper
