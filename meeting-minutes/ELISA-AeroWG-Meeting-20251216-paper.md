## ELISA Aerospace Working Group, Paper-focused Meeting

The Aerospace Working Group shall develop use cases to inform and influence Linux architecture and related tools, work to derive technical requirements for avionics operating systems, and seek to enhance and expand avionics software lifecycle processes, practices, and tools to enable use of Linux in avionics systems that are certified to high design assurance levels.  (https://lists.elisa.tech/g/aerospace)

Paper meetings are organised as follows:
- Work on the paper:
  - Show/ briefly discuss new content, assing reviewers, if needed
  - Decide on chaptes addressed next, maybe what to focus on
  - Discuss ideas for new content
- Task distribution:
  - Who does what until the next Paper meeting (roughly every 4 weeks, see ELISA schedule)
