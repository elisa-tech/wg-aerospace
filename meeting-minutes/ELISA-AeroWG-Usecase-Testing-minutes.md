    - The specific license choice was entertained in a combined Aero+SGL call with no feedback specific to Aerospace.  SGL has already adopted.
    - Using https://github.com/elisa-tech/meta-sgl as the ref files to PR in
  - [DONE](https://github.com/elisa-tech/wg-aerospace/blob/main/demos/copilot/src/monitors/Dockerfile#L108) Container update for ogma-cli:ogma - https://github.com/nasa/ogma/?tab=readme-ov-file#compilation
    - **ANNOUNCEMENT** Image is pushed, update by doing a `make prep` and then `make dev` to get into the container to try the `ogma` command.  The container prompt after `make dev` should now provide some version info to help us troubleshoot when things aren't working.
  - Review notes and put updates to proposal for review next week - https://github.com/elisa-tech/wg-aerospace/pull/92

- Salim / Matt work on adjust compile patch approach so we don't check in the pre-built but have instructions in the docs to build after the patch step

**Discussion topics**

- Discuss having Systems WG create a reference system (Kate/Min suggested)
  - Kate proposed - a thought activity for ELISA to compare to Medical & Auto
  - This group suggested, "invite some of the Sys people to our call to talk about it"
    - **ACTION** Next AeroWG call, share what they are doing today / what is a System look like?
    - Draft talking points / questions
      - How would we transition the work if start a collaboration with this group?
      - Ownership of a definition shifts?
      - What would Sys produce that we could use?
      - How would we manage having another WG call?

- Ivan ran through an overview of ogma for Martin and Paul
  - https://github.com/nasa/ogma
  - Next step - going through the app, cleaning up ?tests?

- Martin shared feedback from Wanja - Sending email with more details

## 20251017

- Discussed OGMA template.  Ivan has captured the template [here](https://github.com/nasa/ogma/tree/develop-update-cfs-template/updated_template/%7B%7Bapp_name_lc%7D%7D).

- Calling Ogma with the following invocation generates an app that is the same as the sample app (under the directory output, the location can be adjusted), so it should just work in the emulator with the setup that Salim prepared.

```code
./.cabal-sandbox/bin/ogma cfs --condition-expr 'true'   --template-vars vars.json --app-template-dir updated_template --app-target-dir output


The contents of vars.json is:

$ cat vars.json  
{ "app_name_lc": "sample_app" 
, "app_name_uc": "SAMPLE_APP" 
, "app_name_cc": "SampleApp" 
}
```

- **Next step:**  Now we need to remove the specificity of that app (anything that we don't want, like the dependency on sample_lib, or perhaps the unit tests) and add the hook to the monitors.

Fuzzing tests for a cFS deployment this week

- Is this something we want to demo?  Random data injection / millions of test cases - could do a cabin lights cycle through states?  how do you get full coverage?
- Moon collaborative robots/equipment scenario (cFS/ROS/multi-platform)
- unit tests to start but evolved to seed a random testing of data structures e.g., cFS data structure to json, is it correct.
- Ogma can generate most of the content / comparison
- QuickCheck (Haskell checker)

- Salim
  - Progressing towards a build and currently building and running on QEMU

- Wanja - feedback on getting started / trying instructions
  - vendor free list of dependencies
    - two layers
      - higher level using dockerfile based environment
      - No container, makefile based with all dependencies setup on host
  - sudo-less (both setup and container) (maybe rootless solves part of it - https://github.com/elisa-tech/wg-aerospace/discussions/80)
  - https://github.com/pengutronix/genimage
  - The wrapper may have a corner case with the emulation output having mixed kernel output and print of the test report
    - Suggested serial port to command and get data so it's dedicated
    - Initially could set log level to prevent console output
  - 3 topics ongoing - can we make these more distinct activities?
    - app on linux relevant to use cases
    - testing harness (unit / remote) - (Needs more attention?  Existing work / projects that could more generically to it)
      - Can existing solutions handle this, large assumptions but makes our example simplier?
      - https://labgrid.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html - embedded board control python library with a focus on testing, development and general automation. It includes a remote control layer to control boards connected to other hosts.
      - Noted some interest in this
    - bring infra for configuration / system image generation
      - Can existing solutions handle this, large assumptions but makes our example simplier?
      - Interested in system generation / image creation portion

We did not take any actions around finishing out the use case doc (yet) - https://github.com/elisa-tech/wg-aerospace/pull/92

- Matt
  - Merge https://github.com/elisa-tech/wg-aerospace/pull/72
  - Create cFS build document from https://github.com/elisa-tech/wg-aerospace/issues/52  (Salim to review and use for sample app)
- Salim
  - Get sample application working in emulation  - cmd from gnd to sample app in emulation (network stack based)
    - Done criteria - manual sequence we could later make into a test case and example
- Paul - has a PR waiting with emulation wrapper once 72 merges
- Paul / Ivan - what is the next step on the Raw socket - https://github.com/elisa-tech/wg-aerospace/pull/68?
  - At least a rebase after 72 merges
  - I think doc updates are being handled by Martin's action from a few weeks back on adding the Embedded demo material (doesn't look like we have a ticket for it - https://github.com/elisa-tech/wg-aerospace/issues/33#issuecomment-2992113155)

**Discussion topics**

Goals of cFS demo
- Understand the minimal system components required
  - Ivan mentioned, cFS depends on <stdint.h>,<stdbool.h>,<string.h>,<stdlib.h>,<math.h>
  - Progress towards a Minimal kernel and libc from current emulation build
- Demo Apps 2.0
  - Converstion to C as part of cFS (copilot can generate part of the outline of the apps)
  - Switch app (e.g. how we control and configure what is observed)
    - Still want to support configuration input values
    - Get configuration from a virtual serial from outside emulation to drive config to switchapp (mimic's a comm link)
    - Switch app is a cFS app and uses serial info to drive cFS controls
  - Copilot runs as app monitoring commands/telemetry instead of logs
- Tests
  - Trying to mimic the output/inputs so testing approach doesn't change much

Steps
1) Get sample application working in emulation  - cmd from gnd to sample app in emulation (network stack based)
2) Add Cabin Light instead of Sample App (driven by gnd command example)
3) Add Copilot to detect events, commands and monitor
4) Add Cabin Lights Application to drive Cabin Light by the Switch App
5) Move from networking to serial for gnd command
6) Update test cases

  - Github feature to organize work with “team board” with priority backlog or filter by labels?
  - Other ideas? Github discussions (ACTION to try this)
- Continue cFS debug - https://github.com/elisa-tech/wg-aerospace/issues/52
  - Success!
  - Next step - add a new use case to show cFS plus lights app
    - [Command ingest and sample app](https://github.com/nasa/cFS/tree/main/apps)
    - (1) Ground station app would send the command into the cFS system.  Then sample light app operates based on command request.
    - (2) cabin lights app and switch app - contained within cFS on SW bus.  copilot as a 3rd app listens to the interactions.  Ground station would still send the commands to control the state.
    - Talked about telemetry and copilot with respect to measurement - bus time vs processing
