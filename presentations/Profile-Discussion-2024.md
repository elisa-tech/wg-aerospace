The ELISA Aerospace Working Group is thrilled to announce the launch of a lively discussion series titled "Developing a Minimal, Community Linux Platform for Aerospace". Commencing on Wednesday, March 6, this series aims to identify the essential elements of a tailored Linux distribution suitable for aerospace. Our objective is to create a streamlined configuration profile that is maintained as a community, with a size that is more tractable for safety and security assurance. We will embark on this journey by considering a simple use-case at low criticality. Over the course of the series, the discussion will progressively consider more complex and higher criticality scenarios. Check our event calendar for meetings times and plan to join the conversation so that together we can bolster the future of Linux in aerospace.
