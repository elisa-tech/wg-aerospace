# ELISA Aerospace Working Group

The Aerospace Working Group shall develop use cases to inform and influence Linux architecture and related tools, work to derive technical requirements for avionics operating systems, and seek to enhance and expand avionics software lifecycle processes, practices, and tools to enable use of Linux in avionics systems that are certified to high design assurance levels.

For more information, contact the working group chair, [Matthew Weber](mailto:matthew.l.weber3@boeing.com) or co-chair [Martin Halle](mailto:martin.halle@tuhh.de).
